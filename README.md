# Assistive Technology Ultimate Remote
## This assistive technology device combines infrared and Bluetooth control that can be operated with just 2 or 3 AT switches

In my lifelong struggle to deal with my neuromuscular disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), I've built a variety of assistive technology devices. But the most powerful and useful device I've built is my "Ultimate Remote". It combines infrared control of TV, DVR/cable box, DVD/Blu-ray players as well as IR mouse and keyboard emulation. It also includes a Bluetooth device for iOS switch control of my iPhone or iPad. The first version of this device was created in the late 2015 and it has evolved through several versions. It's always been my intent to document the device so that other disabled people can take advantage of what I've developed. Because it was an evolving design I've not documented it until now. However I've cleaned up the code, redesigned the 3D printed enclosure and it's finally ready to share with the world.

This repository contains all of the files will need to build this device.

A complete tutorial on how to build and operate it can be found on the Adafruit Learning System at [https://learn.adafruit.com/building-the-assistive-technology-ultimate-remote/](https://learn.adafruit.com/building-the-assistive-technology-ultimate-remote/) coming soon.
